Using the samsung s7 edge ive already factory reset it using the system settings Ive heard you should do it through recovery mode Planning to sell it so want to protect or wipe all the data from it before I do so Does this help make data unrecoverable

Whats the difference between doing it from the recovery mode vs through system? Ive already done it through the system settings Is there any way I can wipe it
